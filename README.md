# DeCleanup Network - Celo MVP

🌍 **Website**: [decleanup.net](https://decleanup.net)

DeCleanup Network's Celo-native stack for turning verified cleanups into onchain **Impact Products** and token rewards.  
This repository contains the complete smart contract infrastructure and frontend application for the DeCleanup Network MVP on Celo Sepolia testnet.

## 🎯 Milestone: Core Contracts Deployment (Testnet) & Hypercerts MVP

This milestone delivers the core infrastructure for DeCleanup Network, including deployment of smart contracts and integration of the cleanup submission mechanism. **Note**: Hypercerts integration has been intentionally postponed for future work once rewards and submissions are fully stable. The frontend includes helper code for image generation and metadata, but Hypercert minting is not wired into the live flow.

### ✅ Completed

- **Smart Contracts Deployed & Verified on Celo Sepolia**:
  - `DCUToken` (ERC20) - `0xa282c26245d116aB5600fBF7901f2E4827c16B7A`
  - `ImpactProductNFT` (ERC721) - `0x97448790fd64dd36504d7f5ce7c2d27794b01959`
  - `DCURewardManager` - `0xa462ad03f09e9dd8190d5ce9fec71f0ff835288a`
  - `Submission` - `0x1e355123f9dec3939552d80ad1a24175fd10688f`
  - `RecyclablesReward` - `0xf8f9db39f83ea40d4f9aca72cdbec74b8f5a2900`

- **Frontend Application**: Next.js 16 + shadcn UI with responsive dashboard, verifier cabinet, leaderboard, and cleanup submission flow
- **Impact Reporting**: Optional impact data forms (weight/area/time/waste types) stored on IPFS
- **Recyclables Module**: Optional recyclables submission with photo and receipt hash tracking
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all core contracts
- **Documentation**: Complete system architecture and deployment documentation

### 📋 What's Ready

- **Frontend** – Next.js 16 + shadcn UI with compact dashboard layout, verifier cabinet entry point, leaderboard link, and CTA flow tuned for tablets/desktop. All critical components (stats, Impact Product, actions, invites, verifier tools) are wired up.
- **Impact + recyclables reporting** – Cleanup flow includes optional impact form (weight/area/time/waste types) and optional recyclables step (photo + receipt hash). On approval, `Submission.sol` triggers `RecyclablesReward.rewardRecyclables` (up to 5000 cRECY cap) and `rewardImpactReports`.
- **Contracts deployed** – All core contracts (`Submission`, `DCURewardManager`, `RecyclablesReward`, `ImpactProductNFT`, `DCUToken`) are deployed and verified on Celo Sepolia testnet with proper role setup and treasury configuration.

## Repo layout

```
contracts/      # Hardhat project (Solidity, tests, Ignition module, scripts)
frontend/       # Next.js 16 app, wagmi config, dashboard/profile/cleanup flows
docs/           # High-level docs for architecture, hypercerts, deployment
+ README.md     # You are here
```

## Local setup

```bash
# install deps
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../contracts && npm install

# run web app
cd ../frontend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:3000

# run hardhat tests
cd ../contracts && npx hardhat test
```

### Environment variables

Copy `frontend/ENV_TEMPLATE.md` → `.env.local` and fill the values (Chain ID, RPCs, WalletConnect ID, contract addresses, Pinata keys, Hypercerts network).  
For contracts, create `contracts/.env` with your RPC + explorer keys if you plan to verify on CeloScan.
