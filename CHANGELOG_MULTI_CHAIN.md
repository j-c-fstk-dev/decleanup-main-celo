# Multi-Chain & Base Integration Changelog

## Objective
Integrate the Base network (8453) into the dApp as a "Simple" option (basic cleanup loop), while keeping Celo as the "Deep" option (governance and hypercerts). This follows the `BASE_TO_DAPP_DEV_BRIEF.md` plan, explicitly skipping Workstream D (Mini App Soft-sunset) as per the audio briefing.

## Step 1: Synchronization and Initial Setup
- [x] Fork synced with `upstream/main`.
- [x] Creation of multi-chain config maps in `chain-constants.ts`.
- [x] Addition of Base networks in Wagmi and Privy.
- [x] Addition of Base networks in Hardhat config.
- [x] Creation of the "Chain Picker" UI.
- [x] Mapping of Base contract addresses.



## Completed Steps

### 1. Synchronization and Initial Setup
- Synced fork with `upstream/main` to ensure a clean PR base.
- Created this changelog to track progress.

### 2. Multi-Chain Configuration Maps (`frontend/src/lib/blockchain/chain-constants.ts`)
- Refactored single-chain constants (`REQUIRED_CHAIN_ID`, `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES`) into a multi-chain `CHAIN_CONFIGS` map.
- Added support for Celo Mainnet, Celo Sepolia, Base Mainnet, and Base Sepolia.
- Implemented `getInitialChainId()` to read user preferences from `localStorage` in the browser, falling back to `.env` for SSR.
- Preserved legacy exports (`REQUIRED_CHAIN_ID`, etc.) to avoid breaking 40+ existing imports.

### 3. Web3 Provider Updates (Wagmi & Privy)
- **Wagmi (`frontend/src/lib/blockchain/wagmi.ts`)**: Imported `base` from `wagmi/chains`. Added Base Mainnet/Sepolia RPC URLs and transports to `getDefaultConfig`.
- **Privy (`frontend/src/lib/privy/config.ts`)**: Expanded `activeChain` logic to support Base networks. Included all 4 supported chains in the Privy `createConfig` array to allow future runtime switching.

### 4. Hardhat Configuration (`hardhat.config.ts`)
- Added `base` (8453) and `baseSepolia` (84532) to the `networks` object.
- Added BaseScan API URLs to `customChains` for Etherscan verification support.

### 5. Base Contract Address Mapping
- Mapped official Base Mainnet contract addresses (retrieved from the legacy Farcaster Mini App repo) into the `CHAIN_CONFIGS` map:
  - ImpactProductNFT: `0x8D71Cd7445423CD42293E196B91E47f085E81BCf`
  - Verification (Submission): `0x69715d43EA6D46F65045FCe2391D9B7F89ec819F`
  - RewardDistributor: `0x492065137E07c660DCfAe4dC335A3Fa9C1203dd9`
  - $bDCU Token: `0x30171b7014c02229497cde6745dd3ad821f12b07`
- (ClaimVault is omitted for Base as it is a Celo-specific feature for now).

### 6. Chain Picker UI & Network Validation
- Created `frontend/src/components/network/ChainPicker.tsx`.
- Added a network selection button to the main app `Header.tsx`.
- Implemented a modal matching the app's dark-mode UI allowing users to choose between "Celo" and "Base".
- Selection persists in `localStorage` and triggers a page reload to apply the new chain configuration.
- Refined `NetworkChecker.tsx` to validate against the dynamically selected `REQUIRED_CHAIN_ID` instead of a hardcoded chain, fixing false "Wrong Network" warnings during multi-chain switching.

### 7. Conditional UI Rendering (Base Simple Mode)
- Updated `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to filter dashboard breakdown stats (e.g., Hypercerts, Recyclables, Impact Reports) so they only appear on Celo networks.
- Updated `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardActions.tsx` to hide Celo-specific action buttons (Impact Certificate/Hypercerts, Apply for funding/Sponsor, Create/Join Impact Circle) when the user is on the Base network.
- Ensured the Base experience focuses strictly on the simple cleanup loop (Submit -> Verify -> Claim).

### 8. Environment Documentation
- Updated `frontend/ENV_TEMPLATE.md` with a new "Base Network (Multi-Chain Support)" section.
- Documented all new `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_*` variables for RPC URLs and contract addresses, allowing developers to override hardcoded defaults if needed.

## Next Steps (Pending Proposal Approval)

- **Base Simple Flow Wiring**: Test submit/verify/claim flows on Base against the mapped contracts.
- **Conversion Ratio & ClaimVault UI**: Once the governance proposal passes, implement the `$bDCU -> $cDCU` conversion UI on the Celo side.
- **QA/Security**: Verify ABI parity between Celo and Base contracts.
- **Workstream D (Mini App Sunset)**: Explicitly skipped per audio briefing instructions.
