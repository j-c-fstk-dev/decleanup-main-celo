# Hypercerts Integration Status

**Last Updated**: January 6, 2025  
**Branch**: `hypercerts-integration`  
**Status**: 🟡 Partially Implemented - Core functionality working, some issues remain

---

## ✅ What's Done

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Hypercerts SDK Integration** (`@hypercerts-org/sdk@^2.9.1`)
  - Client initialization with wagmi wallet client
  - Environment configuration (test/production)
  - Transfer restrictions configured

- ✅ **Data Aggregation** (`hypercerts-data.ts`)
  - Fetches last 10 verified cleanups for user
  - Aggregates impact metrics (weight, area, hours, waste types)
  - Normalizes units (lb→kg, sqft→sqm, minutes→hours)
  - Collects photo hashes, locations, contributors
  - **FIXED**: Now uses Impact Product level as source of truth (handles contract redeploys)

- ✅ **Metadata Generation** (`hypercerts-metadata.ts`)
  - Generates Hypercert-compliant metadata
  - Includes aggregated impact data
  - Formats work scope, impact scope, rights
  - Creates external URL to block explorer

- ✅ **Image Generation** (`hypercert-image-generator.ts`)
  - Creates collage from before/after photos
  - Generates banner and logo images
  - Uploads to IPFS
  - **FIXED**: IPFS hash extraction now handles full URLs correctly

- ✅ **Minting Flow** (`hypercerts-minting.ts`)
  - Full end-to-end minting process
  - IPFS upload for images and metadata
  - SDK validation and formatting
  - On-chain minting via Hypercerts SDK
  - Reward claiming integration

### 2. Smart Contract Integration
- ✅ **Eligibility Check** (`contracts.ts`)
  - `getHypercertEligibility()` - Checks if user is eligible (level % 10 === 0)
  - `userHypercertCount()` - Tracks number of Hypercerts minted
  - `claimHypercertReward()` - Claims 10 $cDCU bonus after minting

- ✅ **Level 10 Restriction** (`verification.ts`)
  - Prevents submission of new cleanups when user reaches level 10
  - Uses Impact Product level as source of truth

### 3. Frontend UI
- ✅ **Eligibility Display** (`page.tsx`)
  - Shows Hypercert eligibility when level is multiple of 10
  - Displays progress toward next Hypercert
  - **FIXED**: Added link to hypercerts.org in description
  - **FIXED**: Removed duplicate mint button

- ✅ **Minting Interface**
  - Mint button with loading states
  - Step-by-step progress indicators
  - Success/error handling
  - Transaction hash display

### 4. Performance & UX
- ✅ **Reduced Console Logging** (`contracts.ts`)
  - Removed verbose logs for already-claimed cleanups
  - Early exit for non-claimable cleanups
  - Only logs actionable items

- ✅ **Conditional Polling** (`page.tsx`)
  - Only polls when cleanup is pending
  - Stops automatically when verified/claimed
  - Reduced frequency (30s instead of 10s)

- ✅ **ENS Resolution** (`useENSName.ts`)
  - Disabled on HTTP (prevents CORS errors)
  - Caching enabled to reduce requests

## 🟡 What's Partially Working / Issues

### 1. IPFS Hash Extraction ✅ FIXED
**Status**: Fixed in latest code  
**Issue**: Photo hashes stored as full URLs (`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybe...`) instead of just CIDs  
**Fix**: Added `extractIPFSHash()` function to handle multiple formats:
- `ipfs://bafybe...`
- `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybe...`
- Just `bafybe...`

### 2. Wallet Connection Error
**Status**: Needs user action  
**Error**: `Could not connect to wallet; sending transactions not allowed`  
**Cause**: Wallet not properly connected or unlocked  
**Fix Applied**: Added validation checks in `hypercerts-client.ts`  
**User Action Required**:
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Unlock wallet
- Verify correct network (Celo Sepolia)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet

### 3. Cleanup Count Mismatch
**Status**: Fixed in latest code  
**Issue**: User has level 10 but only 5 cleanups found (due to contract redeploys)  
**Fix**: Now uses Impact Product level as source of truth:
- If user has level 10, uses available cleanups (even if < 10)
- Only requires exactly 10 cleanups if user doesn't have level 10 yet

### 4. File Sync Issues
**Status**: Deployment issue  
**Issue**: Changes not appearing on server  
**Cause**: Files not synced or build cache stale  
**Solution**: 
- Sync all files individually
- Delete `.next` folder before rebuild
- Clear browser cache

---

## ❌ What's Not Working / Needs Fixing

### 1. Duplicate Hypercert Button
**Status**: Should be fixed, but user reports still seeing two  
**Possible Causes**:
- Browser cache showing old JavaScript
- Files not synced to server
- Build not updated

**Verification**:
```bash
# On server, check if only one button exists
grep -c "hypercertEligibility?.isEligible" src/app/page.tsx
# Should return 1
```

### 2. Submit Button Still Active at Level 10
**Status**: Should be fixed, but user reports still active  
**Possible Causes**:
- `verification.ts` not synced
- `getUserLevel()` returning incorrect value
- Browser cache

**Verification**:
```bash
# On server, check if level 10 check exists
grep -n "userLevel >= 10" src/lib/blockchain/verification.ts
```

### 3. Console Log Noise
**Status**: Should be reduced, but user reports still noisy  
**Possible Causes**:
- `contracts.ts` not synced
- Old JavaScript cached in browser

## 🔧 What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test Hypercert minting end-to-end on testnet
- [ ] Verify IPFS uploads are accessible
- [ ] Test with users who have exactly 10 cleanups
- [ ] Test with users who have level 10 but < 10 cleanups (redeploy scenario)
- [ ] Verify reward claiming works after minting

### 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Better error messages for wallet connection issues
- [ ] Retry logic for IPFS uploads
- [ ] Fallback gateways if primary IPFS gateway fails
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no photos, missing impact data)

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Loading states for each minting step
- [ ] Progress bar showing minting progress
- [ ] Success page with Hypercert link
- [ ] Error recovery (retry failed steps)

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] User guide for minting Hypercerts
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] API documentation for Hypercert functions

### 5. Production Readiness
- [ ] Test on Celo mainnet (when ready)
- [ ] Verify Hypercerts SDK compatibility with Celo
- [ ] Monitor IPFS upload success rates
- [ ] Set up error tracking/monitoring

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Impact Product Level as Source of Truth**
   - Instead of counting cleanups, we trust the Impact Product level
   - Handles contract redeploys gracefully
   - User with level 10 has proven they completed 10 cleanups

2. **Flexible Cleanup Aggregation**
   - Uses whatever verified cleanups are available
   - Doesn't fail if fewer than 10 found (if level 10)
   - Still validates for users without level 10

3. **IPFS Hash Normalization**
   - Handles multiple hash formats
   - Extracts CID from full URLs
   - Works with any IPFS gateway format

### Known Limitations

1. **Contract Redeploys**: If contracts were redeployed, old cleanups might not be accessible
2. **IPFS Availability**: Depends on IPFS gateways being accessible
3. **Wallet Compatibility**: Requires wallet that supports Hypercerts SDK
4. **Network**: Currently configured for Celo Sepolia testnet
