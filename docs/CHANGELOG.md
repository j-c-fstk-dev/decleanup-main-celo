# Hypercerts Implementation Changelog

This file tracks all changes made during the Hypercerts v1 test milestone implementation on Celo Sepolia.

## Changes

### STEP 1 — Hypercert eligibility abstraction (2026-01-20)

**Added**
- `frontend/src/lib/blockchain/hypercerts/` directory with clean v1 skeleton:
  - `types.ts`: Canonical types for Hypercert aggregation, eligibility, and metadata
  - `config.ts`: Environment-aware thresholds (production: 10 cleanups/1 report, testing: 1 cleanup/1 report)
  - `testing.ts`: Simple testing mode detection for Celo Sepolia (chain ID 44787)
  - `aggregation.ts`: Pure function to aggregate user cleanups into summary and timeframe
  - `eligibility.ts`: Main eligibility helper `checkHypercertEligibility()` that answers if user can mint now
  - `metadata.ts`: Builder for Hypercert metadata with hard facts only + optional narrative
  - `minting.ts`: Placeholder for verifier-driven minting (v1 manual/script-based)
  - `index.ts`: Clean exports for all modules

**Why**: To implement Hypercerts as environmental impact layer (not reward, not automated, not coupled to AI). Eligibility must be environment-aware for Sepolia testing vs mainnet production. This abstraction enables incremental, reversible changes without touching core flows.
