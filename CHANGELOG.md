## [Celo Sepolia Deployment & Integration] – 2025-12-16

This release focuses on deploying the RecyclablesReward contract to Celo Sepolia, implementing the full submission flow with contract integration, and enhancing the verifier dashboard with proper access control and data display.

### 🚀 Contract Deployment & Scripts

**Added**
- `contracts/scripts/deploy-recyclables.ts` - Deploys RecyclablesReward contract and wires it into Submission contract
  - Uses real cRECY token address (0x34C11A932853Ae24E845Ad4B633E3cEf91afE583)
  - Saves deployment addresses to JSON for reference
- `contracts/scripts/grant-verifier-role.ts` - Script to grant VERIFIER_ROLE to specified addresses
  - Uses viem-based Hardhat API
  - Includes delay and re-verification to handle blockchain state timing
  - Checks multiple deployment address locations (scripts, Ignition, env vars)

**Changed**
- `contracts/scripts/setup-roles.ts` - Explicitly grants VERIFIER_ROLE to verifier addresses
- `hardhat.config.ts` - Fixed dotenv.config() to load from project root, ensures PRIVATE_KEY has 0x prefix

**Removed**
- `contracts/contracts/MockERC20.sol` - No longer needed after real cRECY token address was provided

### 🔗 Frontend - Blockchain Integration

**Added**

  - `submitCleanup()` - Calls `createSubmission()` with proper parameter handling:
    - Lat/lng to int256 conversion
    - Referrer address handling
    - Impact form data hash
    - IPFS hash reference in dataURI (ipfs://${beforeHash})
    - Explicit gas limit (1M) to prevent gas estimation failures
  - `attachRecyclablesToSubmission()` - Calls `attachRecyclables()` on Submission contract
  - Verifier functions:
    - `isVerifier()` - Checks VERIFIER_ROLE
    - `verifyCleanup()` - Calls `approveSubmission()` with improved error handling
    - `rejectCleanup()` - Calls `rejectSubmission()` with improved error handling
    - `getCleanupCounter()` - Gets total submission count
  - Complete SUBMISSION_ABI with all custom error definitions and CleanupSubmission struct fields
  - Enhanced `getCleanupDetails()` with graceful error handling for missing submissions
  - Improved transaction polling (2s interval, 120s timeout) with better error messages

**Changed**

  - Standardized contract address environment variable names
  - Improved MetaMask detection and prioritization (default over WalletConnect)
  - Better connector configuration for Safari compatibility

### 🎨 Frontend - UI & Pages

### ⚙️ Frontend - Configuration & Infrastructure

**Changed**

- getCleanupDetails throwing on missing submissions - now returns default values gracefully
- Transaction waiting issues - added polling configuration with timeout

## Frontend – MVP Stabilization & Build Fixes (2025-12-13)

This phase focused on stabilizing the frontend, unblocking the build, and aligning UI behavior with the current contract surface and MVP scope.

### General
- Frontend builds cleanly with strict TypeScript enabled
- All blockchain interactions aligned with current contracts or explicit MVP stubs
- No partially enabled or broken features remain

### Blockchain Layer (Frontend)
- Removed assumption of a single contracts index
- Standardized imports under lib/blockchain/*
- Introduced explicit MVP stubs with predictable returns
- Removed non-existent exports and broken references
- Unified getCleanupDetails return shape across app

### Cleanup & Verification Flow
- Enforced single active cleanup per user in the UI
- Cleanup submission lock enforced:
  Submit → locked → verify → claim → unlock
- Verification relies on getCleanupDetails + localStorage
- Removed duplicated status helpers and redeclared symbols
- Verifier approve/reject flow stabilized and aligned with Submission

### Profile
- Fixed bigint vs number mismatches
- tokenId optional and nullable (MVP-safe)
- Graceful fallback for metadata and images
- Staking, streak, and level logic aligned with stubs

### Leaderboard
- Corrected cleanup ownership (submitter → user)
- Normalized DCU balances for sorting
- Limited scan range for safety
- Optional and resilient geolocation enrichment

### Utilities & Debug
- Fixed find-cleanup utility
- Scoped helpers to configured contract addresses
- Improved error handling

### Hypercerts (MVP Scope)
- Image generation utilities exist but are disabled
- CleanupData import assumptions corrected
- Ensured IPFS uploads use File objects
- Hypercert minting remains experimental

### Result
- Clean build
- Clear MVP scope
- Predictable UI flows
- Ready for deploy and iteration
